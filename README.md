1. To show off projects and work to potential employers.

2. Assignment 3 was my favorite.
Although it was probably the most time consuming assignment in my case, I felt
that it was the one that felt most rewarding. The assignment involved a lot of
topics that would become important for the group project afterward and were
immediately applicable.

3. I believe I've grown a fair amount. The assignments gave me an opportunity to
look up problems I encountered and troubleshoot them. The group project made
me feel like part of a team, and it felt much more natural than Comp40
partnerships had.

4. The most important thing I learned in this course was likely security.
Although it was only touched upon towards the end, seeing the XSS attacks
that were possible on the code we had written on assignment 4 was eye-opening.
It was interesting to see a program I had written backfire in that way.
Learning about SQL injections was similarly interesting.

5. I would like to delve deeper into security. Seeing how easy it was to
exploit simple oversights made me curious about how to defend against it.
