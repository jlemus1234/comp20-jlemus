    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The product was a website that displayed map of available customers who were looking for rides, or drivers who were looking for passengers.
        The website made use of geolocation and an associated database in order to store and retrieve all the required information. </p>
    <h1>Methodology</h1>
      <p> Curl was the primary tool used. Each component of the program was tested to ensure that they were working correctly, and instances of incorrect operation
      were noted. Specific points of interest, such as database requests requiring user input, were focused on. These points were tested with a variety of different inputs
      that would not normally be expected, such as scripts and other fragments of code. Incorrect data type submissions were also checked. </p>
    <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
      <p> Several different issues were found, with ranging levels of severity. Some of the problems encountered with the program included basic functionality.
      The vehicle.json page did not function correctly; instead of returning vehicles, it could only return specific passengers. The database would also return multiple records
      for a single user; this could create problems within the client's map. A second set of vulnerabilities permitted the program to run outside scripts and code.
      The lack of input validation allowed users to exploit the lenient requirements of the username field when making a request to the database. The managing of user credentials
    was also problematic; the username used to access necessary data was hardcoded into the HTML, allowing anyone to access it. Additionally, the database lacked any password protection. </p>
    <h1>Issues Found</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>XSS vulnerability</h2>
          <h3>Issue </h3>
          Javascript from outside sources can be made to run on some pages of the website.
          <h3>Location </h3>
          The Passenger page of the website, the map shown to clients.
          <h3> Severity </h3>
          <p> High </p>
          <p> The outside javascript is able to control the Passengers page, potentially putting any visitors at risk. As the page displays user
          credentials, the vulnerability should be given some priority. </p>
          <p> The records with a script as the username are handled by the program as vehicles, and are shown without a name on the map shown to clients.
            This could put users at risk, as they are unable to identify the individual through the map. </p>
          <h3>Description </h3>
          <p>The username field of the records stored in the database can be exploited to store scripts that are later executed when the the records are loaded into a web page. </p>
          <img src="img/flaw3_JSInjection.PNG">
          <h3>Proof </h3>
          <img src = "img/flaw3_JSInjectionPassenger.PNG">
          <p>An outside script causing an alert to appear on the passenger page. </p>
          <img src = "img/flaw3_map.PNG">
          <p>The compromised records appearing on the map.</p>
          <h3>Resolution </h3>
          <p> Validate the user input before storing it in the database. </p>
          <p> var validator = require('validator'); </p>
          <p> username = username.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, ''); </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Duplicate database entries</h2>
          <h3>Issue </h3>
          <p>The database contains and returns multiple instances of the same user.</p>
          <h3>Location </h3>
            <p>Passenger page, the map shown to clients.</p>
          <h3> Severity </h3>
            <p> High </p>
            <p> The integrity of the database is compromised because users can appear multiple times. </p>
            <p> It is a privacy concern because every interaction with a user is being logged. </p>
          <h3>Description </h3>
          <p> A new record is kept and stored in the database every time that a POST request is made to the database.
          This allows for the same user to appear in multiple locations at once, and violates the integrity of the data.</p>
          <h3>Proof </h3>
          <img src = "img/flaw2SamePass.PNG">
          <p> Multiple instances of the same users being returned by the database </p>
          <img src = "img/flaw2SamePassSite.PNG">
          <p> The Passenger page showing multiple instances of the same user repeatedly. </p>
          <h3>Resolution </h3>
          <p> Use functions like update() with upsert enabled instead of inserting every time a request is made. <p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>HTML injection</h2>
          <h3>Issue </h3>
          <p>HTML can be injected into the passenger page </p>
          <h3>Location </h3>
          Passengers page
          <h3> Severity </h3>
          <p>High </p>
          <p>The page can be modified to load offensive content, redirect users to compromised sites,
            and potentially steal loaded user information. </p>
          <p>Passenger page </p>
          <h3>Description </h3>
          <p>It is possible to inject HTML code into the passenger page by exploiting the user input
            provided in the username field. </p>
          <img src = "img/flaw4_cause.PNG">
          <h3>Proof </h3>
          <img src = "img/flaw4_.PNG">
          <p>An image sourced from a different website being shown as a username. </p>
          <h3>Resolution </h3>
          <p>Validate the user input before storing it in the database. </p>
          <p>var validator = require('validator'); </p>
          <p>username = username.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, ''); </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Incorrect database access </h2>
          <h3>Issue </h3>
          <p>The vehicle.json page is implemented incorrectly. </p>
          <h3>Location </h3>
          <p>MongoDB pages on Heroku</p>
          <h3>Severity </h3>
          <p>Medium <p>
          <p>The website is returning the wrong information. It would require knowledge of a user's
            username, and an assumption about the underlying problem in order to exploit the mistake.
            The passenger data is made available by the same program elsewhere regardless.
          <p>vehicle.json page </p>
          <h3>Description </h3>
          <p>The vehicle.json page is not able to return any vehicles. It has been directed to
            search in the passengers collection of the database. This would have broken any component
            that would have depended on the page to retrieve vehicle data.
          </p>
          <h3>Proof </h3>
          <img src = "img/flaw5_vehicleGettingPassengers.PNG">
          <p> The portion of code directing the site to query the wrong collection of the database. </p>
          <img src = "img/flaw5_jlem.PNG">
          <p> A passenger's data being returned by the page. </p>
          <img src = "img/flaw5_JANET.PNG">
          <p> The record for a vehicle that's been previously entered cannot be found. </p>
          <h3>Resolution </h3>
          <p>Modify the program to use the vehicles collection instead of passengers </p>
          <p>db.collection("vehicles"...)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Hardcoded credentials</h2>
          <h3>Issue </h3>
          <p> Usernames are hardcoded into the program. <p>
          <h3>Location </h3>
          index.html code for the map component of the program.
          <h3> Severity </h3>
          <p> High </p>
          <p> It is possible to steal a user's credentials from the website. </p>
          <h3>Description </h3>
          <p> User credentials, like the username, are hardcoded into the program. Anyone
          that would visit the website would have access to that user's information. </p>
          <h3>Proof </h3>
          <img src = "img/flaw6HardCoded.PNG">
          <p> A hardcoded username in the program's code. <p>
          <h3>Resolution </h3>
          <p> Ask for a username on the website instead of hardcoding it, or add a password </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>MongoDB injection attack</h2>
          <h3>Issue</h3>
          <p> It is possible to retrieve data from the database in a way that wasn't intended. </p>
          <h3>Location</h3>
          vehicle.json page
          <h3> Severity </h3>
          <p> High </p>
          <p> Data for users intended to be kept private can possibly be leaked. </p>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          The vehicle.json page allows for unintended retrieval of user information from the database. By modifying
          the entered query to include mongodb commands, the database may return the information of a different user.
          <h3>Proof</h3>
          <img src="img/flaw8_website.PNG">
          <p> The information for the user "testin" is returned by a query instead of empty brackets. </p>
          <h3>Resolution</h3>
          <p> Validation must be added to the vehicle.json component of the program. Characters like the dollar sign need to
            targeted specifically. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Unprotected database</h2>
          <h3>Issue</h3>
          <p> The database does not ask for any credentials when accessing it. </p>
          <h3>Location</h3>
          MongoDB pages on Heroku
          <h3>Severity </h3>
          <p>High</p>
          <p>Anyone can access the database and submit data to it, which can make it unreliable and dangerous. </p>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p> Posting data to the server doesn't require any kind of authentication and it is open to receiving input
          from any source. </p>
          <h3>Proof</h3>
          <img src = "img/flaw.PNG">
          <p> Accessing the database only requires knowing the URL. </p>
          <h3>Resolution</h3>
          <p> Add a password to the database </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p> In the future, I would reccomend being particularly careful when processing input received from users. Special characters that could be used
    to run scripts, commands, or create tags should be removed before the information is stored. User credentials should not be hard coded into a web
    page either, as they would be visible to the pulic. The program could have benefitted from some more debugging to ensure that the right data was being returned
    when the website was used as intended. </p>
